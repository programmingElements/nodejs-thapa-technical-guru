# NodeJS REPL

  The REPL feature of Node is very useful in experimenting with node.js codes and to debug Javascript codes.

     * Read - Reads user's input, parses the input into Javascript data-structure, and stores in memory.

     * Eval - Takes and evaluates the data structure.

     * Print - Prints the result.

     * Loop - Loops the above command until the user presses ctrl-c twice.

# NodeJS Core Module

     * Consider modules to be the same as Javascript Libraries. A set of functions you want to include in your application.

     * Node.js has a set of built-in modules which you can use without any further installation.
     
# Challenge Time

     * Create a folder named it Thapa
     
     * Create a file in it named bio.txt and data into it.
     
     * Add more data into the file at the end of the existing data.
     
     * Read the data without getting the buffer data at first.
     
     * Rename the file name to mybio.txt.
     
     * now delete both the file and the folder.

# Node.js Web Server

To access web pages of any web application, you need a web server. The web server will handle all the http requests for the web application.

Node.js provides capabilities to create your own web server which will handle HTTP requests asynchronously. Yoou can use IIS or Apache to run Node.js web application but it is recommended to use Node.js web server.

  JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation. JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data.

  JSON is often used when data is send from a server to a web page.


# Create a API using Nodejs

  API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, Which is a Software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on you phone, you're using an API.
